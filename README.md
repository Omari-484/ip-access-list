# 🔐 IP Access List – Cisco Packet Tracer Project

This repository showcases a professional **IP Access List (ACL)** configuration built with **Cisco Packet Tracer**, focusing on traffic control, network security, and access management in enterprise environments.  
The project demonstrates how to create, apply, and verify both **standard** and **extended ACLs** to secure and manage IPv4 network traffic effectively.

# ✨ Project Features

This project includes the implementation and testing of **IP Access Control Lists** on Cisco routers to regulate traffic flow and enhance network security.

## 1️⃣ Standard ACL Configuration  
Applies IP-based filters to restrict access from specific source networks or hosts.

## 2️⃣ Extended ACL Configuration  
Implements detailed filtering based on **source/destination IPs, protocols, and ports**.

## 3️⃣ Interface Access Control  
Applies ACLs **inbound or outbound** on router interfaces to enforce security policies.

## 4️⃣ Connectivity & Verification  
Ensures correct ACL operation through **ping tests, packet inspection, and show commands**.

# 🎛️ Verification Commands

Common Cisco CLI commands used to verify ACL configuration and operation:

- `show access-lists` → Displays configured ACLs  
- `show ip interface` → Verifies ACL application on interfaces  
- `show run` → Checks running configuration for ACL entries  
- `ping` / `tracert` → Tests allowed and denied traffic paths
